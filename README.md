# Beam_waist
The shape of a Gaussian beam of a given wavelength λ is determined by only one parameter, the beam waist w0. It is a measure of the size of 
a beam at its focal point (z = 0 in the equations above), where the beam width w(z) (as defined above) is smallest (and likewise when the on-axis intensity (r = 0) 
is largest). From this parameter, other parameters are determined that describe the beam geometry. This includes the Rayleigh range zR and the asymptotic 
beam divergence θ, these calculations are given in the program.
